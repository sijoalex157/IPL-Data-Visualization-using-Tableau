# IPL-Data-Visualization-using-Tableau

# Overview
This project involved using Tableau to visualize and analyze data from the Indian Premier League (IPL). The goals were to create informative and engaging data visualizations to gain insights into IPL match performance and outcomes.

# Data Source
The dataset used contains ball-by-ball data for IPL matches from 2008 to 2016. It includes details like match date, batting and bowling team, batsman, bowler, runs scored, wickets, overs, etc. The data was obtained from Github.

# Tools Used
Tableau Desktop - for data visualization
Excel - for initial data inspection and cleaning
Visualizations
The following visualizations were created in Tableau:

Total runs scored per team over all seasons
Top 10 batsmen by total runs
Strike rate analysis for top batsmen
Bowlers with most wickets
Wicket-taking analysis by bowler type
Dashboard
A dashboard was created combining the key visualizations to provide an overview of IPL match performance and outcomes. The dashboard allows easy filtering by year to analyze trends over time.

# Storytelling
Finally, a story was created in Tableau highlighting the top 5 performing batsmen based on the analysis. The story showcases their overall runs, strike rates, total fours/sixes, and batting averages over the years.

The Tableau visualizations, dashboard, and story provide interesting and interactive insights into IPL match data. The analysis reveals key factors influencing team performance and player statistics.

# Future Work
Potential areas for further analysis include:

Predicting match outcomes based on team strengths
Interactive visuals to compare players' career trajectories
Enhancing storytelling with additional context on players' backgrounds
